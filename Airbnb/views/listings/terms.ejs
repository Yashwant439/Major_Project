  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>WanderLust</strong> — the place where listings are fresh, reviews are honest, and users (hopefully) follow the rules.
  </p>

  <h4>🚀 Your Responsibilities</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Post accurate, respectful listings and reviews.</li>
    <li>Don’t spam, scam, or be shady. We see everything (well... mostly).</li>
    <li>Respect the community. This isn't a fight club.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>🛠️ Our Rights</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>We can remove content that’s offensive, misleading, or just plain weird.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to suspend your account if things go south.</li>
    <li>We may update these terms anytime — and we’ll try to give you a heads-up (unless it’s boring legal stuff).</li>
  </ul> 

  <h4>🧾 Liability</h4>
  <p>
    We’re here to connect great travelers with great stays. But if your trip goes sideways because of bad WiFi or a rude host — we’re not responsible. Be smart, stay safe, and always read the reviews.
  </p>

  <h4>💬 Questions?</h4>
  <p>
    Reach out anytime at <a href="mailto:singhyashwant439@gmail.com">singhyashwant439@gmail.com</a>. We’re human too — mostly.
