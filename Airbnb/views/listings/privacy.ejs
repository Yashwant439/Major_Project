    <p>
      At <strong>WanderLust</strong>, your privacy isn’t just important — it's sacred. Seriously. We treat your personal info the way we’d want ours treated: carefully, respectfully, and with a hint of paranoia.
    </p>
    <h4>📬 What We Collect</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Your name and email (when you sign up or post something)</li>
      <li>Location info (only when you choose to share it — we’re not spies)</li>
      <li>Listings, reviews, and preferences (to make your experience smoother)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>🤐 What We Don’t Do</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>We don’t sell your data.</li>
      <li>We don’t stalk you online.</li>
      <li>We don’t store your passwords in plain text — we’re not monsters.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>🛡️ Security</h4>
    <p>
      We use strong encryption and secure storage practices. Our servers are protected, and we update things faster than your roommate finishes the dishes. (Which... admittedly isn’t hard.)
    </p>
    <h4>🤝 Your Control</h4>
    <p>
      You’re always in charge. Want to delete your data? Done. Just send us a polite email — we’re here to help.
